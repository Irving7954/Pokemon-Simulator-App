This is a very unfinished version of a single-player Android Pokémon simulator app.

At the moment, the user can only select a team of three starter Pokémon at roughly level 50 from three different teams, and then they battle a pre-determined team of three Pokémon at roughly level 50. Currently, most of the attacking moves generally function as expected with a technically functional but confusing UI, but most of the status moves, end-of-turn effects, and more complex field effects like weather still need to be implemented.

With that in mind, the main current issue with the app is that many significant features need to be added before it can truly be considered complete.

For reference, the app can be tested by cloning the repo and then testing it in Android Studio  on an emulator or in developer mode on an actual Android device on Android 33+, but, as I mentioned above, this is not  currently ready for an official release due to the problems noted above.
